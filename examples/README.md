### [sine.R](sine.R)

Simple example of applying MGN/VPGN methods to noised signal
with unit weights matrix.

### [sine_weighted.R](sine_weighted.R)

Simple example of applying MGN/VPGN methods to noised signal
with three-diagonal weights matrix.

### [sine_gap.R](sine_gap.R)

Simple example of applying MGN methods to noised signal
containing gaps, i.e. with diagonal weights matrix, where
diagonal consists only of 0 and 1.
